# Hi there, I’m Melove Gupta!

I’m a Computer Science student with a passion for crafting interactive Web Experiences and Intelligent Tools. I thrive on turning Ideas into Reality, whether it’s building a Voice‑Controlled AI Assistant that listens and responds to your commands or developing engaging browser games from scratch.

My toolbox includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python—technologies I use every day to design clean, responsive interfaces and robust functionality. Among my favorite creations are an AI Voice Controlled Assistant that automates tasks and fetches information on demand, two mobile games called ZerOX and CrossNKnots coded entirely in vanilla web technologies and published on the Google PlayStore, and pixel‑perfect front‑end clones of popular homepages like Coca‑Cola, Apple’s iPhone 16 and Google Search.

When I’m not coding, I remind myself “Coding is Fun… Sometimes!” I’m always learning new techniques, experimenting with frameworks, and pushing my skills to the next level. Feel free to explore my work or reach out.
